# Neovim Config

This contains my personal `init.vim` configuration file

This repository was made to motivate myself to use more `neovim`, which ended up helping me fully make the transition.

### Plugins
I'm using [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) as plugin manager:

###### Installation for Unix, Linux
```sh
git clone https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim \
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```
